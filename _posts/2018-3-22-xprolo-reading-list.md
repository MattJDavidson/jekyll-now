title: #XProLo Resource List: XP Applied: Lessons Learnt from Practicing XP in Consulting vs Product Settings
---

I love going to meetups and finding new things to read. Here's my list of discussed blogs, books and talks from [XPRolo tonight](https://www.meetup.com/Extreme-Programmers-London/events/jfzvbpyxfbmc/).

1. [Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67833.Extreme_Programming_Explained). Have you ever read the source material? 
1. [Balanced Team Janice Fraser](https://youtu.be/Z_Q4Q8rCVpU). This apparently explains the Pivotal Labs team structure well.
1. [Luan Santos' vim config](https://github.com/luan/vimfiles). I don't really get why people would use someone elses verbatim, but it seems really popular at Pivotal! I guess it makes sense if you're pairing a lot? Here's [mine!](https://github.com/MattJDavidson/vcsh_vim)
1. [Joe Moore on pair programming](https://youtu.be/RCDfBioUgts). Potentially not this specific talk, but a specific one wasn't given.
1. [Tuckman's stages of group development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development). 
1. [DjangoCon US 2016 - Keynote: Lucky by Saron Yitbarek](https://youtu.be/BUmV6fsZegs)
